Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. So it is formally recognized with the GNU/Linux. Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.

Linux is the leading operating system on servers, over 96.4% of the top 1 million web servers' operating systems are Linux, leads other big iron systems such as mainframe computers, and is the only OS used on TOP500 supercomputers. Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems. 

Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, smart home technology, televisions, automobiles (Tesla, Audi, Benz, Toyota), digital video recorders, video game consoles, and smartwatches. 

Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. The source code may be used, modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone under the terms of its respective licenses, such as the GNU General Public License. 90% of all cloud infrastructure is powered by Linux including supercomputers and cloud providers. 74% of smartphones in the world are Linux-based.
