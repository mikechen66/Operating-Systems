# Programming with Linux 

Linux programming is the most fundamental programming for all developers 
based on the Linux system. Since the OS has both kernel mode and user 
mode. It is necessary for developers to have an in-depth understanding 
of both system programming and interface programming. All the major Linux
authors including Robert Love, Daniel Bovet, Jonathan Corbet, Michael 
Kerrisk are the outstanding system programmers in the industry. 

Therefore, it is impoerative to learn from them, adopt from them and create
more robust applications to serve the world as a whole. Please read about 
the linux kernel with the following weblink. The first is the Linux repository 
by Torvalds. The others are supporting materials.
