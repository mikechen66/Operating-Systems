These assignments/exercises are for the reader's self-assessment. We do
provide solutions/answers for *some* selected assignments in the directory
solutions_to_assgn/ch'n' (within the book's GitHub repo of course). Doing
the given assignments on your own will certainly help deepen your
understanding and gain confidence; give them a try!

Q1. What if we run an application process from a terminal window, but, while
it's alive, close the terminal window?
Well, it's a known factâ€”the processes belonging to that terminal (technically,
in the process group associated with that tty device) will be killed via the
SIGHUP signal; they will "hang up".
Write a program 'donthup' that will not die even when its controlling terminal
is shut down.

Q2. Further to the previous question, there is a utility on UNIX/Linux that is
used for precisely the same purpose: ensuring that the process is not killed
when its controlling terminal is closed; which is it?

Q3. Write a C program 'allkiller' that attempts to trap all signals on the
platform (using a loop and the sigaction(2) API). Verify that the sigaction(2)
succeeds; does it fail for any signals? If so, which signals, and why?

Q4. atomic_A, atomic_B : As explained in Ch 11, section 'Signal-Safe Atomic
Integers', implement a small application with two processes: A and B. Have
process A complete some work, and signal process B that it has done so.
Do this in an atomic fashion (no data races).

Q5. Enhance the given ch11/defer_or_not program such that sending it the signal
SIGUSR2 causes it to reset the global signal counter variable 't' to zero.
