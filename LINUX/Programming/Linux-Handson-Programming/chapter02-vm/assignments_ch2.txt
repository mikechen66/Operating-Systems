Q1. (If you're running on Ubuntu and the gstack(1) utility doesn't work, pl
do the following assignment, else do both).
Use ps to look up the PID of the bash shell process; then use gstack
to display its (usermode) stack.

Q2. Write a small C program that calls several functions; compile it with the
-g flag, and subsequently use GDB to perform a similar experiment â€“ look up
its stack with the backtrace command. (Tip: You may need to run gdb(1) as root).
