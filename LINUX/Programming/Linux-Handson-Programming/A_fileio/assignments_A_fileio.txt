These assignments/exercises are for the reader's self-assessment. We do
provide solutions/answers for *some* selected assignments in the directory
solutions_to_assgn/ch'n' (within the book's GitHub repo of course). Doing
the given assignments on your own will certainly help deepen your
understanding and gain confidence; give them a try!

Q1. 
In our A_fileio/redirct.c program, we find that the printf data, though
written first, follows the fprintf to stderr write in the log file.
Modify the application to ensure that the printf data is written before
the fprintf to stderr.

Q2. [Adv] Write a dd-like utility; an almost completely flexible copy program.
The user can pass the source, destination, unit size (or blocksize) â€“ the
chunks to perform the I/O in, the number of units, and so on (take a peek at
the man page for dd(1) to see possible options to emulate).
