# Advanced Linux Programming

To compile and build the programs on most standard GNU/Linux systems,
simply invoke "make" from the top directory.  To clean up build
products, invoke "make clean".  Some program listings do not contain
complete, standalone programs; instead, they contain one or more
functions.  Such files are compiled to object files only.
