# Linux System Programming
Robert Love

Write software that draws directly on services offered by the Linux kernel and core system 
libraries. Robert Love, a distinguished Linux kernel contributor, provides readers with a 
tutorial on Linux system programming, a reference manual on Linux system calls, and an 
insider’s guide to writing smarter and faster code.

Love clearly distinguishes between POSIX standard functions and special services offered 
only by Linux. With the foucs on multithreading, the book provides an in-depth look at 
Linux from both a theoretical and applied perspective.
