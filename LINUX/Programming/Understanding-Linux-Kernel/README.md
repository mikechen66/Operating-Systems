# Understanding Linux Kernel 3ED

The book takes readers on a guided tour of the important data structures, algorithms, 
and programming tricks used in kernel development. Important Intel-specific features 
are discussed and relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. Beyond 
covering the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why 
Linux does things the way it does. This edition of the book covers Linux V2.6. Therefore, 
some of the code may be obsolete.
