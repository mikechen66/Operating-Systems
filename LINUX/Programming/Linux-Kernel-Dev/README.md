# Linux Kernel Development
Robert Love

Right now, Linux is the most flexible and powerful operating system that has ever been created, running everything from the tiniest cell phones and embedded devices to more than 90 percent of the worldâ€™s top 500 supercomputers. No other operating system has ever been able to scale so well and meet the challenges of all of these different hardware types and environments.

Robert Love has taken on the unenviable task of teaching the reader about almost every system call on a Linux system. In so doing, he has produced a tome that will allow you to fully understand how the Linux kernel works from a user-space perspective, and also how to harness the power of this system.
