 * thread_block_reason:
 *
 * Forces a reschedule, blocking the caller if a wait
 * has been asserted.
 *
 * If a continuation is specified, then thread_invoke will
 * attempt to discard the thread's kernel stack.  When the
 * thread resumes, it will execute the continuation function
 * on a new kernel stack.
