/*
 * fp_lookup
 *
 * Description: Get fileproc pointer for a given fd from the per process
 *              open file table of the specified process and if successful,
 *              increment the f_iocount
 *
 * Parameters:  p                               Process in which fd lives
 *              fd                              fd to get information for
 *              resultfp                        Pointer to result fileproc
 *                                              pointer area, or 0 if none
 *              locked                          !0 if the caller holds the
 *                                              proc_fdlock, 0 otherwise
 *
 * Returns:     0                       Success
 *              EBADF                   Bad file descriptor
 *
 * Implicit returns:
 *              *resultfp (modified)            Fileproc pointer
 *
 * Locks:       If the argument ‘locked' is non-zero, then the caller is
 *              expected to have taken and held the proc_fdlock; if it is
 *              zero, than this routine internally takes and drops this lock.
