 @function VNOP_LOOKUP
 @abstract Call down to a file system to look for a directory entry by name.
 @discussion VNOP_LOOKUP is the key pathway through which VFS asks a 
   file system to find a file.  The vnode should be returned with an iocount 
   to be dropped by the caller.  A VNOP_LOOKUP() calldown can come without
   preceding VNOP_OPEN().
 @param dvp Directory in which to look up file.
 @param vpp Destination for found vnode.
 @param cnp Structure describing filename to find, reason for lookup, 
   and various other data.
 @param ctx Context against which to authenticate lookup request.
 @return 0 for success or a file system-specific error.
