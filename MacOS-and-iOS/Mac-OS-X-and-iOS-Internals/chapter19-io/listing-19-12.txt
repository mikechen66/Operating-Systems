Listing 19-12: IOService::registerInterrupt
/*!@function registerInterrupt
   @abstract Registers a C function interrupt handler for a device supplying interrupts.
   @discussion This method installs a C function interrupt handler to be called at 
    primary interrupt time for a device's interrupt. Only one handler may be installed 
    per interrupt source. IOInterruptEventSource provides a work loop based abstraction 
    for interrupt delivery that may be more appropriate for work loop based drivers.
   @param source The index of the interrupt source in the device.
   @param target An object instance to be passed to the interrupt handler.
   @param handler The C function to be called at primary interrupt time when the 
    interrupt occurs. The handler should process the interrupt by clearing the interrupt
     or by disabling the source.
   @param refCon A reference constant for the handler's use.
   @result An IOReturn code.
     kIOReturnNoInterrupt is returned if the source is not valid;
     kIOReturnNoResources is returned if the interrupt already has an installed handler.
