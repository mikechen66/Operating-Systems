Notes

There is no sample code in Chapter 1.Origians of Max OS. 

The first release of an Apple operating system after Apple announced that it would purchase NeXT
was in late 1996 with version 7.6. This release represented the initial stage of Apple's new operating
system roadmap. It was the first system to be called "Mac OS." 

Apple's plan was to release full stand-alone installations once a year, with updates in between. Many 
Power Macintosh and PowerBook models that were not supported by Mac OS 7.6 were supported by the 7.6.1 
incremental update. The system originally slated to be version 7.7 would eventually become Mac OS 8.

Mac OS 7.6 required a compatible computer that was 32-bit clean, with at least a 68030 processor. It
offered performance enhancements in several areas such as virtual memory, memory management,
PowerPC Resource Manager routines, system startup, and the File Manager's caching scheme. It also
integrated key Apple technologies such as Cyberdog, OpenDoc, Open Transport, and QuickTime.

Two phenomena were sweeping the computer world at that time: the Internet and Microsoft Windows 95. 
Apple emphasized compatibility of Mac OS 7.6 with Windows 95 and highlighted the system's Internet 
prowess. Mac OS 7.6 included built-in support for TCP/IP, PPP, and Apple Remote Access (ARA). Its 
integrated Cyberdog technology could be used to incorporate Internet features into documents that used 
"Live Objects." For example, live web links and email addresses could reside on the Desktop and could be 
activated from the Finder.
