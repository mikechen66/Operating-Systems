Mac OS X was released in March 2001, but many components, such as Mach and BSD, are
considerably older. Understanding the design, implementation, and workings of Mac OS X requires
examination of several technologies that differ in their age, origins, philosophies, and roles.
Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach is the first book that dissects the internals of the system,
presenting a detailed picture that grows incrementally as you read. For example, you will learn the
roles of the firmware, the bootloader, the Mach and BSD kernel components (including the
process, virtual memory, IPC, and file system layers), the object-oriented I/O Kit driver framework,
user libraries, and other core pieces of software. You will learn how these pieces connect and work
internally, where they originated, and how they evolved. The book also covers several key areas of
the Intel-based Macintosh computers.
A solid understanding of system internals is immensely useful in design, development, and
debugging for programmers of various skill levels. System programmers can use the book as a
reference and to construct a better picture of how the core system works. Application programmers
can gain a deeper understanding of how their applications interact with the system. System
administrators and power users can use the book to harness the power of the rich environment
offered by Mac OS X. Finally, members of the Windows, Linux, BSD, and other Unix
communities will find the book valuable in comparing and contrasting Mac OS X with their
respective systems.
Mac OS X Internals focuses on the technical aspects of OS X and is so full of extremely useful
information and programming examples that it will definitely become a mandatory tool for every
Mac OS X programmer.
