Notes for Unix

UNIX Operating System Source Code Level Six is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions to better separate the functionality â€” system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference. Please take the reference for reference. The ebook is downloaded in the weblink.
