Unix v6 

UNIX Operating System Source Code Level Six is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions 
to better separate the functionality â€” system initialization and process management, interrupts 
and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and 
symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference. In addition, the materials for Unix 
v7 is provided for better understanding the evolution of Unix. 

To make a better understanding of Unix v6, it includes unix_v6_all.c and unix_v6_all.png. with 
regard to the file of unix_v6_all.c, it  actually includes the files with the suffixes such as 
.c(c language), .s(assembly) and .h(head). It is made with the suffix of .c for code reading. 
Users can change it to the file with .txt suffix. It completely complies with the original line 
pages and typeseting of the related Lions Unix v6 code book printed.

It was commonly held to be the most copied book in computer science. Despite its age, "the Lions 
Book" is still considered an excellent commentary on simple, high quality code. It includes the 
core documentation both in English and Chinese. Please note that all the materials included in 
the folder(s) are publicly acknowedged prior to uploading them to the Github. The ebook and the
