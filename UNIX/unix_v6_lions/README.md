UNIX Operating System Source Code Level Six is the kernel source code, lightly edited by Lions to better separate the functionality — system initialization and process management, interrupts and system calls, basic I/O, file systems and pipes and character devices. All procedures and symbols are listed alphabetically with a cross reference. In addition, the materials for Unix v7 is provided for better understanding the evolution of Unix.

To make a better understanding of Unix v6, it includes unix_v6_all.c and unix_v6_all.png. with regard to the file of unix_v6_all.c, it actually includes the files with the suffixes such as .c(c language), .s(assembly) and .h(head). It is made with the suffix of .c for code reading. Users can change it to the file with .txt suffix. It completely complies with the original line pages and typeseting of the related Lions Unix v6 code book printed.

It was commonly held to be the most copied book in computer science. Despite its age, "the Lions Book" is still considered an excellent commentary on simple, high quality code. It includes the core documentation both in English and Chinese. Please note that all the materials included in the folder(s) are publicly acknowedged prior to uploading them to the Github.
